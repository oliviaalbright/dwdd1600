        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p><strong> Boxed Brews </strong> began at the peak of the pandemic when getting your caffeine fix outside of your home became increasingly difficult. For essential workers, those in school, and parents who still depended on it, it was important to us that we provide an at home way to recieve caffeine.</p> 
            
            Now Boxed Brews has been providing caffeine to those at home for a consecutive 4th year in a row with growing success!
            

            
            <h2>The Owner</h2>
                <p>Boxed Brews started in the home of <em>Olivia Albright</em> who prior to the pandemic was a highly skilled barista. When sent home for safety and health, Olivia started drafting the idea for <strong>Boxed Brews</strong> and made it happen. </p>
